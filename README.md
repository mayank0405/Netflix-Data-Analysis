## Problem Statement

As a netflix buff, I have prepared an analytics project on Netflix using SQL and Tableau.

It would be interesting to know about...

- Whether movies or  tv shows are popular
- How to show duration, rating and other important information about movies in one dashboard.
- Which type of rating is most popular in different countries.

## Dataset used 
netflix_tiles.csv

The dataset for the project acn be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies/data)
